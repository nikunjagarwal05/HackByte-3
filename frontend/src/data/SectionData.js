            Think of it like a shared global notebook.

            Wikipedia is like a massive library where everyone can read — and even help write — the books.
            It's a free encyclopedia written by volunteers across the world. Instead of one author, 
            it has many! Anyone can contribute, but with great power comes responsibility. Wikipedia focuses on facts, 
            not opinions. It grows daily, and millions of people rely on it to learn new things. 
            It’s also open-source and non-commercial — no ads, no profit.

          Wikipedia runs on a Neutral Point of View — no opinions, just facts.
          Stay civil! Use Talk Pages for respectful debate. 💬

          Wikipedia articles should never take sides — even on controversial topics. 
          This is called the Neutral Point of View (NPOV). For example, instead of saying 
          “Cats are better than dogs,” an article might say, “Some people prefer cats; 
          others prefer dogs.” Civility means being respectful to other editors. No name-calling, 
          no fights — it’s like teamwork on a school project.

          ❌ Not a blog, soapbox, or personal journal.

            <br />
          Wikipedia is not a dictionary, blog, social media, or a place to promote things. 
          It’s not for original ideas, debates, or news breaks. It is a place for verified knowledge 
          from reliable sources. Think of it like a reflection of existing information — not a place to 
          create new theories or campaigns.

          Wikipedia works when everyone follows the same rules.  
          Use your sandbox 🏖️ to experiment before editing live articles.

            <br />
          Wikipedia works like a shared canvas. Everyone paints on it — but with rules! 
          Users edit pages together, resolve disputes politely, and follow guidelines. 
          Pages are not “owned,” so anyone can improve them. There's also a sandbox to experiment 
          safely. And don’t worry — every change is saved so nothing is ever lost!
