# 🕹️ WikiCraft: Gamified Onboarding for Enhanced Contribution.

Welcome to **WikiQuest**, a pixel-art styled, interactive learning platform designed to onboard new Wikipedia editors in a fun, friendly, and error-proof way.

## 🚀 Overview

Contributing to Wikipedia can feel overwhelming for beginners. Between hundreds of guidelines, policies, and formatting rules, it's easy to make mistakes that lead to edits being reverted or even user bans. **WikiQuest** solves this by gamifying the onboarding experience—breaking down the essentials into small, bite-sized modules with quizzes, experience points, and fun pixel characters.

> 🎯 By the end of the game, a user will gain real confidence to contribute meaningfully to Wikipedia without violating community guidelines.
